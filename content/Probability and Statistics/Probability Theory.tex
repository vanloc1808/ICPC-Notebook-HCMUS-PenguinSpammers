Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with probability $p_X(x)$ of assuming the value $x$. It will then have an expected value (mean) $\mu=\mathbb{E}(X)=\sum_xxp_X(x)$ and variance $\sigma^2=V(X)=\mathbb{E}(X^2)-(\mathbb{E}(X))^2=\sum_x(x-\mathbb{E}(X))^2p_X(x)$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. If $X$ is instead continuous it will have a probability density function $f_X(x)$ and the sums above will instead be integrals with $p_X(x)$ replaced by $f_X(x)$.

Expectation is linear:
\[\mathbb{E}(aX+bY) = a\mathbb{E}(X)+b\mathbb{E}(Y)\]
For independent $X$ and $Y$, \[V(aX+bY) = a^2V(X)+b^2V(Y).\]
